Then Union Food Minister had expressed his helplessness in controlling onion prices and blamed reduction in the area of cultivation and hoarding by traders for the shortage. The government was forced to take measures such as procuring onions from local markets and discouraging exports to bring the prices down. In order to keep a watch on the hoarders, the government has roped in various agencies to keep a check on the hoarding activities over the period of time. Also, with predictions of a \\\"\\\"below average\\\"\\\" monsoon in the year 2019, the Central government asked procurement agencies to store at least 50,000 tons of onions to ensure that market prices remain under control in case of shortage. The buffer stock would be used to control prices in case there is a shortage of onions in the market. Fluctuating weather and decreasing monsoon, causes decrease in crop (onion) output which in turn creates a demand supply gap hence leading to increase in prices or inflation. Summary: Reports from across the country indicate there has been an unnatural spike in the prices of vegetables, disrupting the carefully planned kitchen budgets of millions. An all-India survey on the retail price of vegetables like onions and tomatoes between November 18 and 28 showed that most households in big tier-1 cities forked out around Rs 100 for a kilo, while the average payout in tier-2 and tier-3 cities was Rs 80 per kg. Even the prices of sturdier staple vegetable‚Äîpotato are up about 20%. Unseasonal rains all over the country have ruined vegetable crops and disrupted market operations, creating a shortage. High diesel prices too have added to the woes of consumers as they bear the increased transport costs. The crash and spurt in prices of these essential veggies has unfortunately become an acceptable cycle. For instance, last year saw a high in onion prices in September and a huge spurt again was witnessed this February on account of unseasonal rains. Then followed a sudden spurt in production by mid-March triggering a 30-40% fall in prices. In Lasalgaon, India‚Äôs onion hub, farmers were in tears as prices crashed from Rs 4,000 a quintal to a low of Rs 2,500. The government had to take last-minute measures like banning onion exports as soon as prices soar. One of the reasons prices of potatoes are relatively stable compared to other vegetables is because they use 90% of the warehousing cold storage space and do not rot easily. Similar cold chain/ storage infrastructure for other important veggies, with central support, will give better returns to farmers and provide stable prices to consumers. The more perishable onions and tomatoes can be processed and stored, as is done in many advanced countries. Objective: The Department wishes to create buffer stock of onions in the harvest season and keep the buffer stock intact with its food value, moisture and taste for at least a period of six months from date of storage. We would want the technical solution to be proposed for the following:- (a) Storage of onions in the traditional storage systems and warehouses available in the country. (b) Technical solutions for storage of onions in temperature controlled storage systems, warehouses.\",\n        0\n      ],\n      [\n        \"Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development\",\n        \"# To develop new ways of Waste water management system in rural areas\\n**Description:** To save the water for the secure future the waste water management should be maintained properly in the process of recycling them and reusing it again for multiple purposes in order to ensure that the water gets saved for future. In rural areas, the provision of utilities to drain sewage in a safe way lags behind the provision of water for household activities, including drinking water. This creates severe contamination to the environment of the various villages and reduces the impact of water on the improvement of health. Since the water supply for domestic purposes in rural areas has improved considerably over the years, the quantity of wastewater that is disposed has also increased. Hence, effective wastewater management systems need to be introduced in the rural areas to mitigate the problem of contamination.Wastewater treatment is interconnected with the water chain, and thus affects the environment. Water used by rural homes gets converted to sewage or gets contaminated chemicals and other pollutants. It must be treated before it is released back to the environment. While nature is able to process and cope with a small amount of wastewater, imagine the huge volume produced every day before being released back to the environment. Health and environment are two major reasons to have an urgent focus in this soft-neglected area: health. A contaminated water chain can have disastrous effects on human health, agriculture, marine life, wildlife, and our food chain, to name a few.The aim is to identify and innovate a process of managing and treating waste water in the rural areas and to be able to reduce the wastage and improve the reusability of the water by treating it.\",\n        0\n      ],\n      [\n        \"Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development\",\n        \"# Automatic regulation of valves for release of water based upon soil moisture availability in the root zone of the crop, using artificial intelligence, in a piped and micro irrigation network of irrigation system\\n**Description:** In modern agricultural practices, efficient water management plays a critical role in achieving optimal crop yields, conserving water resources, and maintaining ecological balance. However, existing irrigation systems often lack the precision required to deliver water tailored to the actual needs of crops, leading to water wastage, suboptimal plant growth, and environmental degradation. This problem is particularly pronounced in piped and micro irrigation networks, where traditional methods of manual control fail to adapt dynamically to varying soil moisture conditions within the root zone of crops. The core issue lies in the absence of an automated mechanism that can regulate the release of water based on real-time soil moisture availability. The inconsistency in water distribution and the inability to synchronize irrigation with crop water requirements result in detrimental outcomes for both the agricultural yield and water conservation efforts. To address this problem, there is a compelling need for an innovative solution that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to enable the automatic regulation of valves for water release in piped and micro irrigation networks. By incorporating AI-powered soil moisture monitoring and decision-making processes, this solution aims to bridge the gap between water supply and crop demand, while also optimizing resource utilization and minimizing environmental impact. Key Challenges: Dynamic Water Demand: Crops have varying water requirements influenced by factors such as growth stage, weather conditions, and plant type. Developing an AI system capable of accurately predicting these dynamic water demands is a complex challenge. Real-time Data Integration: Integrating real-time soil moisture data from multiple sensors across a field into a centralized AI system requires robust data collection, transmission, and processing mechanisms. Algorithm Precision: Designing AI algorithms that can effectively analyze soil moisture data, historical trends, and other relevant parameters to make accurate decisions about water release timing and quantities. Valve Control Mechanism: Developing an automated valve control mechanism that can respond swiftly and accurately to the AI's recommendations while considering the physical characteristics of the piped and micro irrigation network. Adaptability: Ensuring that the AI system can adapt to changing environmental conditions, crop types, and variations in soil properties over time. User-Friendly Interface: Designing a user-friendly interface that allows farmers and irrigation managers to monitor and intervene in the system as needed, while also trusting in the AI's autonomous decisions.

Informed by and responding to the common set of arguments used to exclude street vendors. Street vendors may contribute to congestion and grime but so do pedestrians, vehicles, the general public ‚Äì and city governments that fail to regulate traffic and provide sanitation services. While informally traded food and drink can pose public health risks, vendors would welcome more hygienic working conditions to attract customers and to ensure the safety of their goods. Moreover, where public sanitation services are not available, vendors often clean their areas of operation. In many cities, street vendors self-monitor and self-manage their vending sites to reduce congestion, crime, grime, and public health risks. Even after all these things they have to compromise on the Urban design and face a lot of things.

In essence, the root of this problem is not the number of children in a classroom but rather the inability for each child to receive adequate attention. Combining modern technology and 1:1 tuition, students could perform far beyond other students who were being taught in more conventional ways. By combining blended learning (where face-to-face teaching is combined with online learning) with real-time data, we can get rapid feedback in classrooms and use that feedback to further enhance the quality of education. As an example, consider a classroom of 30 students. Ten students with similar abilities may work closely with the teacher, another ten may work through lectures and online tasks using computer terminals, and the final ten may work together on a group project. In the next lesson, students are rotated so they can learn in different ways throughout the course. This kind of approach enables the teacher to focus more closely on fewer children at once. The teacher can also tailor the learning approach for each student based on how well each one works for the individual. Meanwhile, the software on the computer is advanced enough to tailor the content to each student as well. By collecting real-time feedback on each child's results, the course contents can be adapted per student and make it as if they were receiving a one-on-one tuition. This approach allows each student to have their own learning path that's customized to their needs. By doing this, teachers can easily see which students are falling behind and offer more individualized teaching to those students. If more schools were to adopt a similar approach, where some responsibilities could be handled by tech-aided learning methods, more of the teachers' time could be freed-up to give more attention where it's needed the most, even in larger classroom sizes. Further the objective is to come up with ways and means to make meaningful digital application's that can use this information and generate knowledge, spread massive awareness, and support education delivery effectiveness of students into educational ecosystem and generate insights based on data it collected. The objective of this problem statement solution is also to come up with innovative solution which may use digital and physical medium together to make sure specially abled students who are slow learners are identified, their progress is monitored and right alarms and notifications are generated to assist keeping their education on track with elevated motivation. The solution may use technologies like Artificial intelligence, machine learning and internet of things and blockchain to ensure specially abled children are given right systems and interfaces to learn and grow.
